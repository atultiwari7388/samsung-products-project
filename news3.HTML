Recently, in the leadup to this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), 46 of Samsung Electronics’ newest products and services were selected to receive the showcase’s coveted Innovation Awards – with three earning Best of Innovation accolades.

<br><br>

Samsung Newsroom highlighted several of the company’s award-winning innovations when the winners were first announced in November of last year.

Read on to learn more about this year’s honorees in the display, home appliance and memory categories.
